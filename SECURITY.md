# Security policy

TautWeekly for Plex handles SMTP credentials, a Tautulli API key, and optionally a Plex
token. Treat every live configuration file and backup as a secret-bearing
artifact.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability. Use GitHub's
**Security → Report a vulnerability** flow for this repository so details can
be reviewed privately.

Include the affected platform, version or commit, reproduction steps, impact,
and any suggested mitigation. Do not include real credentials, tokens, server
addresses, recipient data, or generated newsletters.

## Supported versions

The latest release and `main` receive security updates; older distributions are
supported on a best-effort basis. FreeBSD Podman support is currently beta and
requires host acceptance testing before scheduled use.

## Operator responsibilities

- Keep `config.json`, `.env`, state files, the deleted-item cache, logs,
  previews, and backups private.
- Use provider-specific application passwords where available.
- Keep the Manager/preview recovery listener on localhost. Do not replace that
  boundary with a LAN/all-interface bind, router port, or firewall rule.
- Optional Tailscale Funnel exposes the password-protected Manager login page
  publicly over HTTPS while the backend remains on its fixed local target. Use
  a unique Manager password; remote viewers need no Tailscale client, and every
  authenticated session has full administration. Container packages keep the
  official userspace runtime isolated from the non-root Manager and require an
  explicit console sign-in without auth keys or tokens.
- Preview and test with a controlled recipient before enabling scheduled sends.
- Revoke and replace any credential that may have entered a commit, log, issue,
  or release archive.

See [the security guide](docs/SECURITY.md) for platform-specific hardening.
