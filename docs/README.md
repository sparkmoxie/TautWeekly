# TautWeekly for Plex documentation

The [TautWeekly Quickstart](https://sparkmoxie.github.io/TautWeekly/)
preserves the supplied Plex-inspired dark Quickstart experience, including
search, sticky navigation, scroll progress, responsive layouts, copy controls,
and terminal demonstrations.

## GUI Preview

- [Open the interactive GUI Preview](https://sparkmoxie.github.io/TautWeekly/gui-preview/)

The static demonstration mirrors the Manager interface with a synthetic
in-memory API and fictional private/account activity. Its production-faithful
newsletter frames bundle public media artwork and dated Rotten Tomatoes/IMDb
score snapshots locally. It makes no outbound application or host-service
requests, writes no files, stores no credentials or entered values, and resets
every temporary change when the page reloads.

## Email States Preview

- [Open the rendered Email States Preview](https://sparkmoxie.github.io/TautWeekly/examples/preview-all-00-INDEX.html)

The single-file gallery renders nine newsletter lifecycle and density states,
including high usage, both Binge Champion treatments, onboarding, warmup,
quiet weeks, a TV-only Trending week, complementary Trending/Top Genre footers,
and the dynamic inbox-preview/count lines. Demo counts are
synthetic; real public Plex Discover artwork and dated Rotten Tomatoes movie
and IMDb episode scores are used only to make the visual regression fixture
representative. TV cards preserve the production episode-row and IMDb-badge
formatting. No Plex token or private server data is embedded.

A Debian, Ubuntu, or other Linux server that runs Docker uses the **NAS/Docker**
distribution; “NAS” is a deployment label and does not require dedicated NAS
hardware. That distribution is fully headless and normally exposes its
authenticated Manager at `http://SERVER_LAN_IP:8787/` to another trusted-LAN
device, without SSH or a server desktop. **Native Linux** is also headless, but
its loopback-only Manager is reached through the documented SSH tunnel or
optional private Tailscale access. Both paths use the same Manager workflow and
produce the same newsletter behavior.

Every Quickstart follows the same GUI-first path: install the package, open and
pair the Manager where required, complete **Config**, run the non-sending
verification, review all six **Previews**, send only to **TestEmail**, and then
opt into **Schedule**. Config can add an optional custom text card before the
release-count/date block; its body is required whenever the card is enabled,
and its uppercase title can append one of six packaged local GIFs.
The [configuration reference](CONFIGURATION.md#optional-custom-text-card) and
each platform README document the complete options. Commands in the guides are
reserved for installation, bootstrap, expert operation, or recovery.

Across these packages, Manager **Settings > Updates** is the primary source for
application, package/image, host-adapter, stable-release, and check status.
Successful results are reused for five minutes, and the normal background
freshness window remains 24 hours. **Current** keeps its green status glow;
every non-current status gives the capability-aware update card an attention
glow. The purple header SVG appears only after a successful check validates a
newer running-application release.
Only Windows can start its existing verified updater from the GUI; every other
guide names the exact host-owned command or platform-native flow and its
limitations.

Every maintained package exposes a package-aware **Settings > Tailscale**
card. Native Windows and native Linux have narrow, package-owned public Funnel
adapters with a mandatory password lock, fixed loopback target, and verified
public DNS/TLS state. macOS, FreeBSD, QNAP, Synology, Unraid, and other
Docker/NAS packages accept only a separately created exact private Serve
hostname because their container Manager cannot own and clean up a host public
route safely. The complete inventory and refusal boundary are in the
[remote-access architecture](REMOTE-ACCESS.md). An active card uses a
motion-safe full-card glow so the additional administration boundary remains
visible.

Before first-run acceptance—or after a metadata-recovery update when ratings or
artwork may still be stale—follow the repository's
[Plex/Tautulli metadata-readiness sequence](CONFIGURATION.md#metadata-readiness-before-acceptance)
before verification, PreviewAll, or TestEmail. It is scoped to the movie/TV
libraries included in TautWeekly, not unrelated Plex libraries.

The `.html` files in the platform directories are self-contained Pages
Quickstarts. The Pages workflow deploys from the repository's default `main`
branch. The Markdown files are the canonical source-oriented guides for reading
directly on GitHub.
