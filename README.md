Manager release updates:

- An optional custom text card before the newsletter release-count/date block,
  with configurable border color/opacity, optional title and subheading, and a
  required plain-text body when enabled.
- Optional public HTTPS administration on Windows through password-gated
  **Tailscale Funnel**, so an ordinary remote browser needs no VPN client.
  Other packages keep their existing private Serve workflow and required
  Manager authentication.
- Capability-aware **Settings > Updates** status for application, package, image,
  and host-adapter layers. A header SVG appears only for a validated newer
  release; Windows can launch its verified updater, while other packages keep
  update authority with the host.
- A responsive Dashboard with guided **Config**, **Verify**, **Previews**,
  **Schedule**, and **Settings** workflows, plus private backups and preview-first
  delivery controls.

See the platform guides for exact setup, mobile access, update, and recovery
steps.

### Windows Manager

Run the native Setup EXE, choose the permanent application folder, and finish
the guided local GUI. Windows adds tray health/actions, optional sign-in startup
and password lock, plus an independent Scheduled Task; **Settings > Updates**
can start the existing verified elevated updater.

### NAS / Docker Manager

Use the unified `ghcr.io/sparkmoxie/tautweekly` image with the explicit
`server` or `unraid` profile, bootstrap the authenticated Manager, and keep
private state under `/data`. QNAP/Compose wrappers and Unraid Apps retain
their host-owned verified update and recovery paths.

### macOS Manager

Pull that same public amd64/arm64 image with the `desktop` profile and one
checksummed standalone Compose file—no clone or local build—then bootstrap
Manager access. Private state persists under `/data`; Mac-owned
semver/digest pull, recreate, and rollback keep Docker control outside the
container. The verified archive/local-build wrapper remains a supported
break-fix fallback.

### Native Linux Manager

Install the matching amd64 or arm64 archive and access the authenticated,
loopback-only GUI through the documented tunnel/bootstrap flow. systemd owns the
service and schedule while `tautweekly update` retains verified host update and
recovery authority.

### FreeBSD Podman Manager

Install the beta Podman package, bootstrap Manager access through the documented
tunnel, and use the same guided GUI. rc.d and the host wrapper retain service,
backup, verified update, health-check, and rollback ownership.

Container users upgrading from either v0.22.0 image should follow the
[unified image and migration guide](docs/CONTAINER-MIGRATION.md); it preserves
existing data and documents the old Mac-image compatibility window.

## GUI Manager

The responsive Manager is the primary workflow on every maintained package:

- **Set up and configure:** Dashboard guides first run; Config manages
  connections, SMTP, branding, library scope, delivery exclusions, schedule,
  rolling backups, and the optional custom newsletter text card—including its
  six-choice local title GIF selector—without hand-editing JSON. Stored secrets
  remain write-only.
- **Verify before sending:** one non-sending validation records connection,
  library/user, SMTP preflight, and local-preview evidence. Previews renders six
  newsletter states, and controlled TestEmail delivery stays separate from
  production recipients.
- **Operate deliberately:** Schedule reports and controls only the package's
  supported delivery lifecycle; Settings covers access, Windows public Funnel
  or package-private Tailscale HTTPS, capability-aware update status, release notes, diagnostics,
  and recovery. Manual and scheduled production delivery share one guarded
  live-roster refresh and eligibility path, 30-second default attempt spacing,
  and fail-fast handling for batch-wide SMTP failures. Host-owned packages keep
  update and service authority outside the web process.

## Current newsletter behavior

- **New releases:** Movie and TV additions with artwork, summaries, ratings,
  and episode details.
- **Weekly highlights:** Hot new releases, trending movies, and the week's
  top movie genre keep discovery useful even during quieter weeks.
- **Personal recaps:** Each recipient sees their own watch time, viewing
  highlights, and movie **Watched** marks.
- **Binge Champion:** A privacy-preserving award celebrates the week's
  leading viewer.
- **Adaptive layouts:** Welcome, active-week, quiet-week, and milestone
  newsletters fit each recipient's activity.
- **Custom announcements:** Add an optional branded text card for your own
  message.

Tautulli is the required activity source. Optional direct Plex access enriches
ratings and artwork when the server exposes them. Detailed provider, privacy,
cache, and rendering rules live in the references linked below.

## Get started

1. Choose your platform above and open its interactive Quickstart.
2. Install the latest stable package, open the Manager, and complete its guided
   GUI setup. Platform commands are only for installation, private bootstrap,
   or documented expert/recovery work.
3. In the GUI, run **Validate, save, and verify**, inspect all six private
   previews, and send a controlled TestEmail.
4. Enable scheduled delivery in the GUI only after the result is correct.

The platform guides contain the exact requirements, commands, metadata-readiness
sequence, update and rollback behavior, network guidance, and troubleshooting.
